# pzcheeseriareact

##This project lists the available cheeses and allows user to calculate price for entered weight##

### Due to my limited knowledge of Reactjs, I have done the front end in a fairly simplistic way using state instead of advanced features like redux etc.

* The api url "https://localhost:5001/api/cheeses" is listed in the Homepage.jsx
* The api call logic currently does not handle errors from server
